      "text": "@rithviknishad @nihal467 I have taken a deeper look into this, and I can confirm that this needs to be fixed on the API side by adding a new property (ex: configuredMinQuantity) to the inventorysummery response that gives the minimum quantity required for each item. \r\nReason: The invertorysummery API response and the min_quantity API response are both paginated. When the min_quantity list grows bigger there will be a scenario where all the items from invertorysummery might not get their corresponding min_quantity from the min_quantity list, which will lead to displaying the incorrect min quantity on the UI.\r\n\r\nAs API is already returning an is_low indicator, this shouldn't be a big change on the API side, once that is added, we can come back and fix this on the UI"
