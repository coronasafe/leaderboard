      "text": "Hi @bodhish,\r\nWorking on your suggestion to use css text-transform instead of `startCase` and `camelCase`. From what I'm seeing I think it won't be able to replace those methods . Correct me if wrong\r\n\r\n> Is a keyword that converts the first letter of each word to uppercase. Other characters remain unchanged (they retain their original case as written in the element's text).\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform\r\n\r\n`sampleDetails.status` can have value \"COMPLETED\". We need \"Completed\".  `capitalize` class won't do that. Similar issue for `sampleDetails.doctor_name` and maybe in other places.\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/wR1YZEkNsO\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "> @Omkar76 wasn't the issue about removing and using custom utility functions instead?\r\n> \r\n> This PR is just replacing with another package and updating the imports and doesn't make a noticeable difference in the final bundle size.\r\n> \r\n> We could achieve a much lower bundle size if we built the utility functions within care right?\r\n> \r\n> cc: @sainak\r\n\r\nI believe the size reduction is significant (547 -> 122). We can keep this PR on hold until @sainak has implemented the utilities to replace lodash. If that reduces size significantly more than this we can merge that instead. "
