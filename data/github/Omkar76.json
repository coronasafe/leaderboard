      "text": "> @Omkar76 wasn't the issue about removing and using custom utility functions instead?\r\n> \r\n> This PR is just replacing with another package and updating the imports and doesn't make a noticeable difference in the final bundle size.\r\n> \r\n> We could achieve a much lower bundle size if we built the utility functions within care right?\r\n> \r\n> cc: @sainak\r\n\r\nI believe the size reduction is significant (547 -> 122). We can keep this PR on hold until @sainak has implemented the utilities to replace lodash. If that reduces size significantly more than this we can merge that instead. "
