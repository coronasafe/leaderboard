I need this in the context of creating a presentation for a subject in school in which we had to address an issue. I would be grateful for your answers to these questions if it is within your competence and capabilities.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1 - What DevOps services and tools does your project use? For each tool, please write how it is used in the project.\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 - What was the test coverage like? Provide \"covered lines\" metrics - absolute or relative (if you measured them)."
