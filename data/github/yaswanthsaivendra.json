In almost all cases we would not want to mock the database, the database is what we are usually testing against. mocking is useful when there is an external service involved, like an SMS API or an integration with an API, in our unit tests we mock all the responses they can give ( success, failure, exception ) and test if the function we wrote handles every case correctly.\r\n\r\nYaa ik that i haven't mocked any database interactions in the pushed code . I just asked it coz I first wrote the test by mocking database interactions, later i realised that isn't a gud idea. So i changed it. Thanks for sharing ur opinion. :smile: "
