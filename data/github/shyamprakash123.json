The issue is about hiding the feed tab for patients who have a linked bed to them but that linked bad has no camera asset attached to it.\r\n> \r\n> Example: https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/a3910fb7-db3d-4ddf-aa39-1f20e61d1453/patient/400cbedd-98d7-4f8f-b835-155ba71cc28d/consultation/6ae67a3d-305b-4404-bfd6-b21b0d0f8426\r\n> \r\n> This patient has an attached bed without a camera, in this case the feed tab should be hidden: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/279035666-18248974-0ec7-44ac-819a-45245be372a9.png)\r\n> \r\n> The bed's location is `NICU` Here's the corresponding asset: (same location) https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/a3910fb7-db3d-4ddf-aa39-1f20e61d1453/assets/ed2edbd7-4581-434e-8c6a-4620b4d0a4a0\r\n> \r\n> It's an HL7 monitor and not a camera, there are no cameras in the same location as that bed, so the feed tab should be hidden.\r\n> \r\n> @nihal467 can you double check this message for any corrections?\r\n\r\n@Ashesh3 I understood the problem and one more thing should I also hide the Camera Feed button in the Top Section of the Patient Dashboard?"
