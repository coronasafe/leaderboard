Before assigning this issue to myself I got the solution and thought that I will be completing it in few minutes but I misunderstood the issue earlier before your explanation. After trying out a different approach I noticed that the 1st administration is not being displayed in the table when the 1st administration was sent into second page of paginated table. I thought it was because of my work and I was making changes to my work but that bug is already existing at care.ohc.network. I fixed that too."

So I started working and forgot to assign it to myself. Guess we started almost at the same time.\r\n\r\nI checked your latest PR, setting the limit to null removes it from the URL but that breaks the purpose of limit. There are 14 patients displayed per page instead of 12. Also the pagination component which is used to navigate to different set of patients is replaced by red colored text saying \"Do not render Pagination component, when limit is <= 0\"\r\n\r\nI changed my PR to a draft PR. So let me know if you can resolve this, I will close my PR."
