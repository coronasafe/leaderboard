      "text": "**Relevance of \"recommend discharge\"**\r\nThe reason we have an option to Note \"Recommend Discharge\" in log update and then a separate \"Discharge from CARE\" option is because in most cases, the Treating physician would clear the patient for discharge, but the actual discharge may only happen after one of multiple of the following events are done:\r\n1) The patient is on an infusion (medication given through drip) and the doctors may have asked nurse to wait 2-3 hours for drip to complete before sending the patient\r\n2) The patients bill may need to be settled\r\n3) The patient insurance claim process maybe ongoing\r\netc. \r\n\r\nTherefore the actual discharge (noted in CARE through \"discharge from CARE\" on patient dashboard) may only be done hours after the treating physician recommends discharge. \r\n\r\n**To-Do**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Design a flag for \"recommended Discharge\" to be visible on the patient list and patient dashboard. the design may be kept consistent with the design for \"Action\". refer to #5272 . or better the design of actions may be reimagined keeping this use-case also in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "Clarification on the Issue:\r\n\r\n**How the Review Feature should work:**\r\n- The user must be able to set a review time in the consultation/edit consultation form. Or later on in a log update form.\r\n- Once the review time is set, then within that time if a Log Update is not filed for the patient, then the \"Review Missed\" Badge must appear on the patient card.\r\n- When a log update is filed for the patient, the preselected review time must come pre-filled in the 'review after' field in log update.\r\n- With every log update filed, the review clock must reset.\r\n- If the user, the the log update doesnt edit the 'review after' field, the same interval will continue for review, with the review call resetting with every log update.\r\n\r\nEg: I file a 1 hr review in consultation form. I file a log update in half an hr. The log update form will come prefilled with 1hr in review after field. I can choose to edit it to 2 hrs. Then once i save the log update, the clock for review must reset. If no logupdate is filed in another 2 hrs, the \"review missed\" label must appear on the patient grid in patient list. Then once i file a log update, the clock must be reset again with whatever time is mentioned for review in the latest log update.\r\n\r\n**Issues in CARE now - to be resolved**\r\n\r\n- [ ] When I select a review after time in consultation form, and later open the edit consultation form, I see the review after field as blank. I must be able to see the review time i had set previously and also have the option to edit it.\r\n- [ ] When i edit the consultation form to add/edit review time, such time must be considered from the time I edited the consultation, and not the time the original consultation was filed.\r\n- [ ] When a review is missed, an a \"review Missed\" flag appears on patient card, the flag must dissappear once I file a log update. \r\n- [ ] The log update form must come pre-filled with the previoud review time set (either on the consultation form, or on the previous log update)- the user must have option to edit it. \r\n- [ ] The \"review missed\" flag must come right below the patients name on the patient dashboard as well (https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/7ab27974-32c8-4e36-bdf9-dbf102524718/patient/cc52390c-ac8a-4af5-9806-f3df7ee1795a/consultation/7037609e-3c25-45ed-bfd8-e01c346cbd45)\r\n\r\n"
