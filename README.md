## How to add a new member?

Create a new markdown file with the github user name in the `contributors` folder. For example, if you want to
add `john-doe` as a contributor, create a file named `john-doe.md` in the `contributors` folder.

The file should contain the following content:

```md
---
name: John Doe
title: Full Stack Developer
github: john-doe
twitter: john-doe
linkedin: john-doe
slack: U02TDGQQPMJ
joining_date: "09/05/2022"
role: contributor
---

** A Bio about John Doe **

```

All members marked with `role: core` and `role: operations` will be will be hidden from the leaderboard section by default.You can toggle their visibility by changing filters.

You will be able to see the users profile page at `http://localhost:3000/contributors/john-doe`.
